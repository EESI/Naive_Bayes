This guide explains how to interpret the results in the "max log likelihood" file.

The result file is a CSV with three columns: the read ID, the classified class, and its log likelihood.

This example set uses a k-mer length of 9.

For reads that do not contain consecutive "A", "C", "G", or "T" strings equal to or longer than the k-mer length (9 in this case), the classified class is marked as "sequence contains no valid kmers."

Example:
100225
../../refSeq_db/basic/download/fna_grouped_by_species_tax/100225/GCF_003391095.1_ASM339109v1_genomic.fna

The above read (the first in the given reads file) does not contain a string of consecutive "A", "C", "G", or "T" that meets or exceeds the k-mer length of 9. Therefore, the result for this read is "100225,sequence contains no valid kmers,".

Note that the output file is named "*max_1.csv". The number after "max" indicates the starting read. For example, "result_max_1.csv" contains results starting from the first read in the input file. "Result_max_101.csv" contains results starting from the 101st read.
